        <p>An amusement park is a park that features various attractions, such as rides and games, as well as other events
             for entertainment purposes. A theme park is a type
             of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a theme,
              often featuring multiple areas with different themes. Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals,
               amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation. They are more elaborate than city parks 
               and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups. While amusement parks 
               often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that
                revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects.</p>
